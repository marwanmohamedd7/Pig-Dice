# Pig Dice
"Pig Dice" is a fun and easy-to-play online game where two players take turns rolling a dice to score points. The game continues with players rolling the dice to add more points, but if they roll a one, their turn ends, and they score nothing for that round. The first to win the majority of rounds—either three, five, or seven—becomes the champion. It's a perfect blend of luck and risk-taking.

To kickstart the game:

1- The first player enters their name to personalize the gaming experience.
2- The second player follows suit, adding their name to the competitive mix.
3- Both decide on a target score that will determine the winner of each round.
4- They choose the total number of rounds for the match, opting for a quick best-of-three, an intermediate best-of-five, or an epic best-of-seven showdown.
